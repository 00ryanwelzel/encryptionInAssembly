# encryptionInAssembly

## (Ryan Welzel 6/1/2025)

Implements several classical encryption and encoding schemes in MIPS Assembly

---

Features:
- Provides low-level insight into how data encoding and classical ciphers operate at the assembly level.
- Captures real-time keystrokes from /dev/input/eventX (wherever the keyboard is)
- Logs keystrokes to keylogger_output.txt


Requirements:
- Linux OS
- GCC compiler
- libudev headers


Install dependencies with:
- Bash: sudo apt install build-essential libudev-dev
